# Introduction to Robotics

This document presents the fundamental concepts of robotics, its historical evolution, definitions, and the essential components that constitute a robotic system.

## Origin and Evolution

-   **Origin of the Term**: The word "robot" was coined in 1921 by the Czech writer Karel ÄŒapek in his play "R.U.R." (Rossum's Universal Robots). The term derives from *robota*, which means "forced labor" or "serfdom," and was used to describe beings of organic origin created to serve humans.
-   **First Commercial Robot**: In 1956, the company Unimation produced the **Unimate**, the first commercially sold robotic manipulator. Its function was to perform specific tasks in industrial environments.

The advancement of robotics in recent decades has been driven by several factors:
-   **Miniaturization**: Reduction in size and improvement in the performance of processing units and sensors.
-   **Advancement of Algorithms**: Development of more sophisticated techniques for control and task execution.
-   **Cost Reduction**: Popularization and mass production have made robots more accessible.
-   **Increased Efficiency**: Robots have become faster, more precise, and more flexible.
-   **New Applications**: Expansion of the use of robots beyond manufacturing, covering areas such as medicine, space exploration, and services.

## Definitions of Robotics

Robotics is a vast field with multiple definitions. Two main approaches are:

1.  **Replacement of Human Tasks**:
    > "The study of machines capable of replacing human beings in the execution of tasks, both related to physical activities and decision-making." (Siciliano, 2009)

2.  **Connection between Perception and Action**:
    > "The science that studies the intelligent connection between perception and action." (Siciliano, 2009)

Essentially, robotics focuses on the design, construction, and operation of robots, which are programmable machines capable of interacting with the environment.

## Multidisciplinary Nature

Robotics integrates knowledge from several areas:
-   **Mechanics and Mechatronics**: For the design of the physical structure (body) of the robot.
-   **Electrical and Electronics**: For the development of power systems, sensors, and actuators.
-   **Control**: To ensure that the robot's movements are precise and correspond to what is expected.
-   **Computing**: For the implementation of algorithms that process data, make decisions, and control the robot. This is where **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** plays a crucial role.
-   **Biology**: The observation of living beings inspires the development of algorithms and mechanisms (bio-inspired robotics).
-   **Social Sciences**: To study and design the interaction between robots and humans, especially in cooperative tasks.

## Components of a Robotic System

A robotic system operates in a continuous cycle of perception, processing, and action. Its fundamental components are:

-   **Sensors**: Devices that collect data about the internal state of the robot (e.g., joint position) and about the external environment (e.g., cameras, sonars).
-   **Control (Processing)**: Central unit that processes sensor data (perception), makes decisions based on algorithms and the task to be performed, and generates commands.
-   **Actuators**: Motors and other mechanisms that receive commands from the control unit and perform physical actions, such as moving an arm, turning a wheel, or interacting with objects in the environment.

This cycle can be summarized in the diagram:
`Environment -> Sensors -> Control -> Actuators -> Environment`

## The Intelligent Robot

The integration of Artificial Intelligence elevates the concept of a robot to that of an **intelligent robot**:

> "A robot that perceives the environment and takes actions to maximize its chances of success." (Murphy, 2009)

The main characteristic of an intelligent robot is its ability to **learn and adapt**. Instead of just following pre-programmed instructions, it uses AI techniques to:
-   **Deal with unstructured environments**: Dynamic and unpredictable environments, where objects can move or appear unexpectedly.
-   **Improve its performance**: Adapt its actions to perform tasks more efficiently and robustly, maximizing the probability of achieving its goals.

This ability to adapt is what allows intelligent robots to operate autonomously and effectively in the real world.
