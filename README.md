# Robotics

This repository contains the materials for the Robotics discipline, part of the Artificial Intelligence Specialization course.

## Week 1: Introduction to Robotics

The first week of the course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of Robotics, including its history, components, and the different types of robots.

### Topics Covered:

*   **Introduction to Robotics:** Fundamental concepts of robotics, its historical evolution, definitions, and the essential components that constitute a robotic system.
*   **Types of Robots: Manipulators:** A look at manipulator robots (robotic arms), their structure, joints, and the difference between serial and parallel manipulators.
*   **Types of Robots: Mobile:** An overview of mobile robots, including terrestrial (wheeled and legged), aerial, and aquatic vehicles.
*   **Classification of Robots by Level of Autonomy:** Understanding the different levels of robot autonomy, from fully controlled to fully autonomous.

### Files:

*   `week_1/1_Introduction.md`: Overview of the fundamental concepts of robotics.
*   `week_1/2_Types_of_Manipulator_Robots.md`: Detailed notes on manipulator robots.
*   `week_1/3_Types_of_Mobile_Robots.md`: An explanation of the different types of mobile robots.
*   `week_1/4_Types_of_Robots_Autonomy.md`: A description of the levels of autonomy in robots.

## Week 2: Sensors and Actuators

The second week of the course delves into the essential components that allow a robot to perceive its environment and act upon it: sensors and actuators.

### Topics Covered:

*   **Introduction to Sensors and Actuators:** An overview of the importance and classification of sensors and actuators in robots.
*   **Proprioceptive Sensors:** Detailed notes on proprioceptive sensors, which measure the internal state of the robot.
*   **Exteroceptive Sensors:** An explanation of exteroceptive sensors, which collect information from the environment.
*   **Actuators:** A description of actuators, the components responsible for robot movement.

### Files:

*   `week_2/1_Introduction_to_Sensors_and_Actuators.md`: Overview of sensors and actuators.
*   `week_2/2_Proprioceptive_Sensors.md`: Detailed notes on proprioceptive sensors.
*   `week_2/3_Exteroceptive_Sensors_Part_1.md`: An explanation of exteroceptive sensors (Part 1).
*   `week_2/4_Exteroceptive_Sensors_Part_2.md`: A continuation of the explanation of exteroceptive sensors (Part 2).
*   `week_2/5_Actuators.md`: A description of actuators.
